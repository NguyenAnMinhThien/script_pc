my note
At my level, I should work at the high level, that means many tasks need to more user friendly, the more friendly, the more easier to produce and export.
But if we concentrate in this region, because we reuse many other design, so we can not make the new things, and may be the job will continue like other people's paths.
in this region, it often focuses into the drying technical, the only thing make the life more meaning, we should do by adding other flavor. That is the poem, painting, music.
To save time: use api, old model.
To have the change point: have the effect from cultural, art.

About graphic design by code?
Graphic is related to many knowledge, there are many commands in ffmpeg, other, to use the dedicated function in graphic to design an animation picture, we can not imagine the effect via command. So often, the design need to do by graphic app. But after complete these image, 
we can transition the effect to these image by commands. That means the auto phase only can be interfered in a step.

what is the reason I resign ?
Because I see I have understood many knowledge in this region, if I continue to go in deep in this area, I will waste time, the deeply knowledge can not apply to the freelance jobs in the future. And the time come over, only money, 6 months will past and there are no thing helpful. Instead of that, should try this change, not for yourself but more for the people in our family.

I return is correct, but in this time, when there are many things in this family relate to .. , we need to encounter this problem, because this is a life, and we need to encounter when we feel.

the value of a pixel not change in a time, so the DCT will get 0 value.

the invention: from a current, it raises the lighting from a semicondutor point.
motion vector: a point change from a position to another position via a vector.

why we need prediction method in a MPEG picture ?
&& : block transformation , motion compensates prediction, forward prediction, backward prediction, interlace sequence.

a picture is created by the many frames, if we want to predict the area have the air plane, have we can predict the new position to calculate the motion vector ?

we have a feedback line from the output to input, so the prediction algrorithm base on the method of determination :

- the determination method : when a dry equaltation is created, it always be explained by the wet words, and these words will lead to a specific result called as determination.

with script, programing, any task can be done by combine many function module separately. The flavor is what function modules we build.

how to use par alias to search a wilcard ?
par -f '"*zip"'

in the alglorithm, we have many frames as the input data, we want the encoder know the vector motion, then with many frames, we only store 2 things: the original image and the vector motion.
what is the blending function ? why we need to have the factor

Why Is MISRA C Important for Embedded Systems?
The C programming language is one of the most popular languages for embedded systems because of its intrinsic capabilities, such as performance, portability across hardware, and direct control on memory. However, certain C language constructs can lead to programming errors, undefined behavior, or implementation-defined behavior.

This introduce use an image to guess the type of that info is telling using the Neutral network technology. There are totals 3 : VGG (16 -19 layers) , .. are the pre-trained model can be used to predict an image. 
There are a factor need to understand that the resource and the time consumming to gen a model is long. So use a pre-trained model is a key.
when an image is inputted, we assign it into an array and beyond the view of training model, it is a object.

General
need to complete the whole process in each phase, to see the overall difficult, in each phase we may do step by step, but when complete a phase, we must see the overall result of our product.

This life is not only go to work and make money, leave the good things for your own family, we need to think far. That is for other people, the common happy for everyone. Only when you believe you can do, for not only you but also everyone, you would have the promotion and a strong mind for doing that.
