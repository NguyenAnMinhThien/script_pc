io file related to research about split bus module
tbu list actually is extract from IF spec, include many IP instances related.

/shsv/ipw1/BUS/users/hungcao/X5H/ref
why we need to define the connnect between submodule ? because we split out to small modules, but we need to sure about the functional of the overall, even there are some clk that will provide for other modules in other sub so we need to sure the connect .

/shsv/ipw1/BUS/users/thiennguyen/05_Task/BUS_IOGEN_X5H/script/ars_def.pl

wholee
why lstq is divided into 2 channels r - w ?
BusECM error is collection from ECM control from a specific IP , why ?
Clock name  , clock net, skbr, clock frequency, IP sellect ?

flexnocc
tip
increase more cpu to open that flexnoc more faster.
how many parts there are in a pdd file ?
Gen a pdd to RTL ?
get this dir:
$win/07_Reasearch/01_Flexnoc

how you know a initiator can access to a target ?
if you should add the info of both master and target into the bus module ?
&&: NIU, 
what is the info of arbiter and decoder ?
if I put more than 1 address to access to a target, what is different in the pdd file >
where is a complete pdd file after modify, and it is ready to use for gen RTL code ?
how to lear flexnoc ? get a file complete and a file after flexnoc gen, see the diff.

rulee
add the sub content and subject by the wrong name, with more a character to the end.
prinn: this must be print all in Note convert .
write for the after final page, from the bottom to arrange the newest knowledge.

current run -ecm_check , this is a code verilog, can't get the success running, the error fail when finding the way to run the -ecm_check into the module, because we have the error (even if there is still not run into the code !)
the purpose is to sure there is no error when access to the slave is removed, that meaning durring the process running, busecm will now assert error signal (the error must be 0 ) all time, but how I can see this value, If i need see this value by waveform ?

abouti the pattern flow : how the UVM know it is the last address of the last slave in SV ? in apb test pattern, we use uvm do on with  , but in axi pattern, how we use SV to allow make the constraint into the transaction address. ?
all this pattern flow is on the SV code, but what file we do ?
if a slave is hang-up, how we can control in sv ?
what is the step to create an VIP model ? 
when I need to get coverage points, as in descripe, how I can get ? must have the data predict first then have the response , see the response if it is the same with the already, so we need to set up a time to wait , how ?
all the whole env, before we can get the coverage report, we need to dump out the value of the important points need to cover, and after all finish, we get that value in auto coverage to judgement by a tool .. , different with xcelium !
Note: when I add only axi pattern, we also have the info in the apb cov table. 
Note: when you move to the new dir, need to run again the whole 03_ -all, this need to avoid the error not find out file .. in comp step, then lead to error in pattern running, related to lack vip model .., . Not run 03 -comp but must to run the whole in this case.

file xrun.history is the final file you see for all the commands excute durring the process, also for comp cadenvip, but in x5h we only see when it run the pattern, in v4m we can see the detail both on comp and the vip cat how it create
what is data compression , split ddr channel , apply gpu in bus ut, the usefull of HOSTGR_L in bs optimize , how to apply the .tcl durring the process, ?
why we need to choose the cr52 boot core ? what is dmac and why need to choose dmac ?
the workflow of uvm is ? from the time to transmit to the time to success ?when a instance create, a class master, will have the reset start and reset end , after reset and load ipmmu table , the master will create and transmit transaction over the bus module . Final, we have a report about all the transaction complete and not complete, uvm error, fatal, at the end of file. durring the transaction, each transaction is inserted into uvm model. 
when we need ram and dbsc ? when at the end of phase, dut is completed, connect all bus together, we connect dbsc and ram into bus, later, there is access from master to ram and we dont need to create slave in this case ?

Current the master can not access to slave, the decode error response 2, this means ipmmu there is no info about this slave ? if the address of slave are stored, what file in the env store this info > and where is the code xcelium call load this table into the simulation >
the final response from ipmmu is for bus ?
if a class is driver in uvm, the input of it will be sequencer, the output is a completed transaction is driven into dut, so where is the place we store the info of the transaction and transmit it to dut >
use this file Ã¢ÂÂÃÂ ÃÂ  Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ ./scripts_x5h/gen_apb_test.pl to correct again the apb patterns.
why I have remove 2 apperw0 and 1, allow access from axperw to apperw2 but the matrix table apb only the same with, there is no info about : /shsv/ipw1/BUS/users/duongnguyen2/04_Verification/02_UT/X5H/X5H_BusUT_Env_10Jan/sv/test/apb_test/APPERW2__AXPERW2APPERW2_ASYNCX_apb_test.svi ?
the data read from an apb slave is random ? no, it have a constraint both when that apb raising the signal and uvm env reading from, so if the data read from not equal a value decide before, we have evalute it is uncorrect .
why ecm check and the address related for the case ..FE0?
if i have a sequencer rasing randomly from the uvm env, what code will gen out the driver to dut beyond the axi transaction ?
ARS def:  this is a module and it belong to an hier, each hier may have many many ars modules, if i use different clock, we will see the clk differently, but why in spec there are many

how to check out and check in a file in sharepoint? use more -> checkout and more -> check in
what are the modules will connect to axrt ? why we need axscp connet to it ?
why axmm divide into 3 axmm0,1,2 , the final is axmm2 is the hier decide of the whole axmm, so if i want to debug on axmm , i need to devide into smaller, what will be included in the debug method ?
what is fcprc ? it is a compress moduel ,if fcprc is access by axmm2, that mean data after get out from dbsc ram can compress by go via axmm2, should remember that all data need to go via bus to manage, so we need to connec via axmm2 .
when I check out a file from spo, if i can change the info by coppy from another file ? no, this is for protect the file .
what the knowledge is common and what is the specific ?
how to use ls in a short to combine with rm command ? use ls -u .
how to auto notify the anoucement in email after update an bus repo ?
PCIe and normal access to ram is have the same way to treat ?
how to turn off the loop in while ? break
can i sort -u -o the files and that files will output normally ? need to change permission first : chmod 755 for the file excute the command sort -u
if i up a to an svn, just svn add and commit ? no, it must the latest svn co, to sure the data we are modifying is also follow the newquest update.
the compare in perl have what special ? compare between string eq , ne but between number it is == , between variable store string and store number is also different .

Finally, you can also use the glob operator if you prefer, something like this code sample:
@files = glob("*.*");
foreach $file (@files) {
  print "$file\n" if -f $file;
}
I'll write more about the glob operator in other tutorials, but hopefully that's enough to whet your appetite.

Build an env to learn about env with many files: a window to run, make change by gen from root, a window for vim edit, used to make change. the vim is issuse from tree -f. 

Dvide the phase into 2:
get input and running, end of this phase will call a infinity loop
wait for the result in a file (macro waiting)
get output from env and put in a folder storage.

Currently I cannot understand the spec base on the dry data.
getting the line after an image or a line after -, if that line is not appear after the picture, will not get anything.

The function of any module: via CT items and UT items in module management, click to hyperlink. We also can see the info of the reused module from previous chip.
in each folder may have file discovery_this_folder, in each file may have the notation for that code, also store the info at 07_code for some code want to store later.
Another of learning is from rcar-redmine, from the issuse of previous people and by following the msteam chat.
# , // : use to mark the note in a file of code or the output file name from find command .
Discovery_ : pre_fix for finding the info about a file that is used to mark the content discovery.
& ; this is for the key word we want to capture from the info 
@temp : this is for the content related to renesas in note for all
add the tail into file name: _rm to find out that file top, remove later and later untill there is no info we don't know
todo: can done but need time and effort
againn : need to read again

important : need to read again
common : the content not related to the main stream

nhap: current i have 2 way to go. find out in deep about the ipmmu table, what files will be used to force value from apb slave, why the first address address is always can access, the second is fail, for apb. the second is focus immediate ly, build again environt ment and get the same fail result .
prinn
first, need to specify the general problem, then go more details
what is the relationship between rtl and ifspec ? rtlgen is related to if_spec because it use if_spec to specify what instance is used in bus module and gen out the signal from, .
why we need cache mem when need ipmmu access ? mem cache is the first connect to the initiator, may have another mem store the table reference but they may be far from.
why we seperate into many pages for translation address ? this is related to algorithm, the utlb will find out the address at middle, then middle of middle divided by 2 untill it find the correct page contain the address need to translate. 
what is the size of each page it store ? the utlb and ipmmu are the same function, the only different is utlb is smaller and it directly to master ?

we will excute a read sequence, class p_sequencer and specific target is axrt_cr52ss0mx , in this read sequence, we want the expected value is defined in the constraint, so what we define in read sequence, it will read all value available from a min addr to a max addr and will notify the error. 
in uvm_do_on with, we use the constranint to force only do 1 transaction to the target address, and the IP excute is defined in axi_sequencer[name]

fcpr : is a module from image, used to compress data and later transmit via bus module.
err_edc : prefix for error rasing have edc, the IP and `bus module need to define EDC module are ... in a file .
ECM hier and ECC hier are different. each domain will have a ecm hier, does it related to our bus module ? this is same with ecm module in bus ??
in UT sec/saf , when we want to excute write or read, must have the initiator excute that operation, that is the IP connect to that bus. and we write 1 to a bit position to clear the fusa register.
in dma, we have sydmac and rtdmac, note the IP connect to bus to issuse the sec and safty condition (in file UT_secure_saf) , how we can toggle some error signal ? tick

If you cant keep the first, you can remove the remain. Every thing is to have 2 side, belong this 2 side we have the behavior for correspondent.
should do the action in a practice the skill, to not waste the time, for example, if you want to input the word should do in fastly, if you want to remember something, should remain it in a large knowledge and remember later at a time, or something need to bring the honest into the jobs, you can know that knowledge or you can try it now but should spend it later to learn, should do by another method that is faster.

1. modify the sim snapshot,because UT of X5h use snapshot from CT
2. prerun
3. create test : gen_env for a bus (dont gen for all because will consume many time), but if we do this, it the routing is a long path, contain many bus, how we can transmit patter for this long path.
4. to limit the time, in dut/rtl.f.X5H.rvc_UT : with the open module, use RTL, with module no need to use, use BBOX, so BBOX is a module have limited function compared to rtl, if this is true, we see BBOX also declare input/output ports ?
5. compile
6. create pat list
7. run simulate
8. debug : go into rch3-sim

hide the tool in word online

how to get all info from the output of previous command ? in mobaXterm, we have the full list of running, 

How to percent in vms system
instance : must like the instance name in module manament list
TM_X5H/.. : the name of pattern must be the same with the name declared in checklist

May I need to create the module list again ? auto UT will be need for this env ?
there are some error durring 03_build -all, is recorded in log_03_..
the 03_buil -all default gen all steps : soma, coverage, slv_add.csv ,.. and gen_env.pl -all (not a specific bus module)

check the TBTOP and found the bus module in module list
modify into env the files in error 
current no need for coverage so remove gen_coverage/

TBTOP is created true, soma file is also created true
Have create out the model because Denali compile have done.
The sequencer for this master and slave are not correct ?

my axi cover lib: many class
what belong to UVM, 
how our bus related to CPG, memory, CPU, ram, bus between each other , the registers connect between bus, the module and function inside a bus module, how to inject an error to check the handle of bus when there are errors, 
the revision between 3754 and 3755 to see the different between 

issuse from meeting
Denali fatal error 
mismatch address between active and passive
axmm awuser[5] must match with awadress [35] ?

hang up the assert reset, wait for a time but there is no response then assert this reset so the transaction is stoped at the middle, the later behavior is not in maintain.
apb coverage fail, 
gen apb test
dummy response return, so when we fix Vcc for axsp and axrt then the request from CPU will stop at these bus module, will not out to fray or cr52 slave.  (here are axsp for fray and axrt for cr52)
fix isreq_axi_frays = 1 of axsp io file, so it will generate dumy response.
at master side, we have a pair edc gen and check, also for slave

want to have control over all sequencer from a central place . 

run UT pattern with log file, get the UVM error if have issuse related  to fusa register . get z_get.. to get the pass info
need to dump wave ? if need, how to check ? open the fusa register of each pattern to get the info about the register error ?
there is no the different between old and new env.
log file to store the error related to UVM eror
check pass base on the UVM _ error word

reset assert at the middle time of transaction, so the transaction not completed 
run CT for dedicated server, also used for debug

run again all with master-rtl, build with IO file new , will there is no error and no hangup in this case.
with the old one, confirm there is an error when access to slaves are removed.
use waveform for this case. see the response of the slave when it is accessed.

consume the time for only 1 job at a time, that make the qi float in your head in a noron in head, we can control qi at that time also . Remember the purpose of is to control qi , if we not control and follow the nature , not effecc to qi that will make our in force mind. 
when store in the word, and read again, should remove the have read content , this will reduce the time when we read again later . Also need to consider again about making the paragraph and use ?? to make the content can read later about, if we should to diff these case ?
when store, we can store at both note and word online, use the different mark but should remember to collect them again to refer later in future.
Need to have the impact to that operation, for the normal case without the review in the future we can talk or make a behavior by action to remember temporarily.
we need to devide into dedicated knowledge and the general knowledge, the general knowledge is to use tool, script, RTL, systhesis , DFT check, HDLC check, these are the common knowledge for , and with each knowledge dedicated, we need to focus on the detail later with the function of that module. Also when reading we devide into 2 kind, the knowledge need to remember and the knowledge need to know it is exist , and we just know at that point, the detail info we will focus on later. Also, the logic of a problem need the qi operate , at a time when sit down we just capture the info and can not link the info we see (if we already know and actually understand so we can learn it fast just by a see).

NOTE: to run paralell the patterns, we need to run on different sim, because if two patterns run on the same work dir that will lead to the wrong and cause error because the vpd file is load overitten together.

a master connect with a utlb is different with a normal master ?
what is the case we have the second bridge ?
that is when the first is to convert x2x, the second is to convert apb , the final slave use apb protocol, or the first x2x and the second also is x2x.

tip
change with return in vim
%s/V2\:/\rV2/g
turn on all command have input
q: enter

practical
Also, need to be careful when use macro, should be the macro is independent about the reg of before and after this macro.
Build a habit to use git when writing code, when there are something there are many change durring the time then need to have a way to manage the version.

Hibernate PC
It help PC start where they come, this save the app runnign in ROM instead of RAM.
When leave for several of hours, but still want to keep apps, this is a good choice.
Hibernation harm PC:
Yes, because hibernation is very stressing on the hard drive.

Basically what hibernation does is to store a sort of snapshot of the system on the hard disk, nowadays weÃ¢??re talking about several GBs of data and doing this sort of memory dump, which is a forceful writing of such a big amount of data in a few seconds, is not doing anything good to the hard drive in the long run.

Better not abuse of this function if thereÃ¢??s not a specific need, if you use a Linux OS with a SSD, the power up and down take less than a minute, making hibernation mostly useless, unless you have to keep open a lot of programs.

haved remove Auto_coverage to $win, mv again later when sim axi
 from 8:00AM@Dec. 16 to 8:00AM@Dec. 17. : not access to svn 

copy the pattern_list_gen and pattern_list_gen_apb from the v4m to v4l to run for the case have glue logic, also for copy the mst_apb_tabe.csv and mst_table.csv for get the require to run.
later date, when need to gen again the constrain, go into script_v4l, modify gen_env , replace gen_all to gen_constraint.
to add wave, run 2_div.. -wave to gen list with waveform, no this option not available
run again for these cases: the glue logic of master and slave, the fail value in checklist old, the dbsc0 access slave in exception.csh, the diffrence pattern list between old and new after run line 179 at Auto_UT.csh
AXRS__AXCCMX 
AXRT__CSDE2MX
AXVIP0__DULMX

master gluelogic itself can not make transaction and send to slave glue logic, the simulation is only for the cases with master is having.
keep the old matrix table from v4m , no need to build the new one, remove the patterns started from the master are glue logic
tip
cannot stat of the coppy command tell that the file need to coppy not exist.

when changing a Auto coverage folder, need to change in 2 places, the auto_cov.csh and the file mk_rslt_table.pl in the INPUT/script/mk_re.. , then this file will copy out to the TBMAKE/V4L/ 


when input to bus_test_items, the input order is different, 11 40 -> 13 - 38 + 4 ending row.

what do you know about lib ?
In lib there are two types: the lib will refer other lib until it found the root code, this make every thing clear. the other type is lib refer to other lib but there is no final founding, we need to import the lib dir to the tool durring the running.
About RAM, we have TSMC, also ROM, these are the special part in a chip that there is no code rtl but macro. When we use ram or rom, we link to a macro, not a rtl code.
in lib.f.X5H.dut. , we use -v for link rtl file, -y for folder, these are called lib that mean will there are something will call it durring running.
in Flexnoc gen for axmm, there will axmm0 and axmm1, all they are built from many smaller modules, the big call the small until all are clear.
in the lib, can not add more or lack lib.f.x5h. , if not there will be error during running process.

QOS
If I have qos controler, I need to monitore the time of each slave is capturingl or transmit the data, the bandwith between require and are in free space, how we allocate in bus ? if we have allocate in bus, then if there are using exceed this limit then we must have a machanism to control, but how ?
edc
if we need to insert the error injection , how we can do ? enable a register and then see import the error in a port ?




open the need, ignore the undeed

so to add a new class of apb, we add the foreach_tran_apb_ax..._seq in my virtual sequence lib apb.sv and add new class in apb/test with the data want to raise to a specific slave.

model_info : glue logic
my_axitranscion data: have add 
remove coverage axi for these cases.


in all files we only have axi access to apb at sv/test/apb_test , 
axi model access to slaves , 

about coverage, it will get follow the axi master used list
if the master is used, it will get cov of all slave that in the require matrix , the generatte fucntion will get path to that master and create path. with each clk raising, and the rready, rrestp valid matchin it will gen voc

defautl the bs after compile will get script need to run, svlib (of cadence) , uvm test name
/shsv/ipw1/BUS/users/thiennguyen/BusUT_v4l_run_new/BusUT_v4l_run/sv/test/my_axi_seq_lib.sv
with each transaction from axi master it will call this code, line 213, dump to log file
