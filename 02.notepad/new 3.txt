practical:
how I can build a whole module, change it in the CT env to test for my design , replace the old has exsist
dftwrap rep

force mstp of the main bus, this is not true because this signal is imported to both three sub module.

And it will open $file in an appropriate application for that file. The argument can also be a URL, so

H'0_E9A0_0000 armm0
the axmm1 and axmm2 dont have bus reg info in cf phase.
in address map, there is no armm1, armm2 so with these bus, how we check the reset function ? , we just check the toggle, no check the 
 axmm2 are also the repeated , but will not have register to check it.

the vimdiff of the two files are the same, probe.tcl
the env sim3 can be run with the paralel

about the method
a general list for all enough
a pat list list out the bus u want
because the number of bus are many, so u can grep out and run for it auto matically.

after run the first pattern for hangup cases,
