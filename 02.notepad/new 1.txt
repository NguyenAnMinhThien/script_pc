how I can trace a wrong signal ?
trace from the root of error and then later to other signal to it. The file contain the moduel call these signals..
what is the step to setup a reg in ct env ?
first we force a mstp reg by simulate command, later will try by setting via command in reg, arm code.
open wave form to check if the clk has stopped or not .
what are the correct signals in the perw ? spec

1)
cho em hỏi, e có thấy những tín hiệu trong sub module :
hoặc xuất hiện ở IO file cũ 
hoặc xuất hiện ở submodule khác
hoặc chỉ xuất hiện một mình nóhoặc chỉ xuất hiện một mình nó

2)
subA connect to subB and subC
subB connect to subC
-> 3 cases

if devide many subs, there are many cases need to solve.

Follow this path, if there is the uncorrect step, the signal go into bus module will be worong

if I can dump wave at the middle state of a pattern running ?
no, because there is no writen data during running, if we set at the first step, we will have the running process and dump value durring that simulation, also because this , it need more mem in the simulation.

why after change the code, it is also be hangup at this point ? because all macro is dump at this address, so all have the same hangup at this point

in simv, the command make it complete will be printed, not the command make it hangup, so the time chip begin to hangup is start from the later.

because you jump into a command before macro end, so although you are not excute the macro, it still jump into the macro and hangup in there.
when you include that macro, and excute in test.s, it has dumped that value into ram page mem, and then later although you dont call, it still jump into wrong address because it has dump that macro into the first page of assembly code.

because the condition for wait statement is wrong, so it will jump when there is no correct time.
the pattern you have pass is because 

there will some case of compare
cmp r3 r4, in rm_prot, there is no any command before branch and MEND
cmp r4 r5, in check_state, there is 1 command before MEND
cmp r3 r5, in wait_state, there is 1 command before MEND

ldr r4, [r3]
and r3, r6, r4

if and success, and r4 r6 and store to r5 , 03ff 0003 => 0003, but the r5 is just 0

	- with the case reset, check the initial value by after toggle, force again to continue the pattern, continue to dump out the register value
	- with the case mstp/reset, force again 2 signals (for raise the clk and reset the module)

the local data is in our , just link into ,

recommend put our .. into 13:40 register 
not run regression , just run sanity, degrade. There are some sim version, have many change, need to get all at regression mode, 
support pattern for auto judge
vmanager rerun , request to run again, dump again the waveform ? how ?

axperw: lbsc : 30000000 is in perw

DRAM is the acctual mem, virtual buffer will read data from this region, the rt-vram include rt-sram and a part of virtual buffer. 
About the module connected to rt-vram: ecm - error interupt controller, cpg, axi bus, apb bus.
&& cache data to DDR memory
access protection of protect area, flush operation, 
Exclusive access: with rt-sram, it is exokay responsse to Load - Exclusive, if store-exclusive is success, rt-sram returen exokay and update ram, but if fail by the other interfereance of other processor, rt-vram retyrn okay response and dont update ram.

each hier is allocated an address space, why SMMU and LSTATQ are located an address region in address map ? so these hier have allocated this feature will have the address for them.
address map sumary, address map for rt
rt-sram, rt-vram in v4m
code sram cdsram
code sram mirror read/write
rt-vram (memory)
rt-vram (memory mirror 1 MB)
rt-sram (memory)

there are the relation ship between interface spec and address map
what is the difference between code v sram, sysram, rtsram ?

actually before run sim for an env, it will load full compile data into ram, so the memsize when we submit the jobs to lsf server must be > the compile data memsize.
the current temperary :
with full run, 32 GB
with full run have wave, 48 GB
because the open wave is depend on the number of module we open the wave, so the amount of data to open is not increase as the linear relation ship.

Use grep command, u can trace out the root cause of the problem race out.

why we have pass_r but not pass_w in ut ?
run the pattern in Xprop env .

RTL force, delay, so the Xprop will filter these features to see if the effect of x signal will effect to the function of pattern or not.
which pattern is interract with many other modules we will run it on Xprop env.

heree begin 0521
we can vimdiff two folder to see the files are the same or not.

%s/\(Error signal is unexpected value.*\)\(\n\)\(.*\)\(\n\)\(.*\)\(\n\)\(.*\)\(\n\)\(.*\)/\1\3\5\7/g

at the time exit the pattern in terminal, not open the waveform of that pattern, if not, the file wave will not open correctly and lead to the wrong open later.

the savesnapshot restore will use all the setting of the previous into it, it leads to : when we want to apply error signal list and tcl usr_sim.tcl file, it still get the old setting.

becaue the snapshot only load the code as command like stop, .. , and the procedures it does not load so when we use snapshot it will get the naming of the command the stop calls. -> the procedure content can be difference, but the naming of proc and the root cause raising that proc can not be difference.

Actually the commit to sim3.x.x like the operation of branch in git version control, with each sim, we put into a sim branch while the main code still run success in main trunk.

There will have a control power for turning on the RAM and we load code into it., about ram and rom control, it just is a signal to control ?

Nghĩa là em phải đổi chương trình chỏ 0x31012D0 -> 0xC13012D0 thành 0x31001920 -> 0xC13001920


store the value in CRUN mode and when go to dspt, return to SENTRY at second time, the new value will be 0 , this is expected . ! No, SCP ram will not be included in the System reset factor in this case.

why we need to define a mask in FlexNoc ?
this is physical design, when we have a mask, it will use this value to AND with the current address for decission if it is allow to go through or not.
