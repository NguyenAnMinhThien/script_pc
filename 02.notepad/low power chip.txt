bus weekly meeting
- force the signal mstp and sfrst again but it can not continue the simulation .
- devide into 4 groups:
the normal pattern, with dummy_reg
the bus that is the target of the msys setting, just test edge
(the bus is in the repeated )
the bus special of Yamanaka Sho , when it connect to sram, rt-ram, ..
- reset signal is also hangup

have the simple pattern for mstp signal
in deep about debug, stop, resume in bs, ucli to controll the flow, save , restore, load, a file (but not success dueto errro about wrong pointer ) , 
refer to axrt_sfrst_ to see the error log of save and restore the wave.

restart again the axrt_sfrst_chk_cr52 with the saved wave/
encounter with network setting, 


if we will store the R2 into R1
we will use a loop in wait_sentry ?
